## Completion Summary

Wave 5 baseline remains merged to `main`.

Wave 6 remediation state:

- Hard-cut track `int/6a-hard-cut` merged to `main` via [#179](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/179) after task PRs W6-CUT-01 [#167](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/167), W6-CUT-02 [#169](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/169), W6-CUT-03 [#162](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/162), and W6-CUT-04 [#165](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/165).
- Unification track `int/6b-unification` merged to `main` via [#180](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/180) after task PRs W6-UNI-01 [#166](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/166), W6-UNI-02 [#170](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/170), W6-UNI-03 [#164](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/164), and W6-UNI-04 [#163](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/163).
- Parity track `int/6c-parity` merged to `main` via [#181](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/181) after W6-PAR-01 [#168](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/168), W6-PAR-02 [#173](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/173), and W6-PAR-03 shard PRs [#171](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/171), [#174](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/174), [#175](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/175), [#176](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/176), [#177](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/177), [#178](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/178).
- Gate track `int/6d-gates` merged to `main` via [#182](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/182) and final closeout W6-GATE-02 merged via [#183](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/183).
- Parity continuation wave W6-PAR-04 merged via [#185](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/185), [#186](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/186), [#187](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/187), [#188](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/188), [#189](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/189), and [#190](https://github.com/rputnam0/dnd_sim/pull/190), reducing strict blockers but not yet reaching blocked=0.
- W6-PAR-05A re-grounded the continuation wave against the live canonical builders on `main`: strict parity baseline is now 1332 blocked shipped records (background 59, species 103, spell 530, trait 640). The prior `coverage_report.json` and `capability_report.md` values were stale at 1411 blocked and have been refreshed.
